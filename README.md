# Neural Network Number Classifier

This project represents an exploration into the world of neural networks, showcasing a practical application of machine learning. Our primary objective was to create a neural network capable of classifying handwritten numbers, such as those found in documents and digital images.


## Implementation

Here's an overview of the key steps involved in this project's implementation:

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Collection:** We began by sourcing the MNIST dataset, a widely-used resource in the machine learning community. It contains a vast collection of 28x28 grayscale images, each representing a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating our model.

2. **Data Split:** The MNIST dataset is neatly divided into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to teach our neural network, while the test set is reserved to assess how well the model can perform on unseen data.

### Model Development

3. **Villia Python:** For constructing and training our neural network, we opted for just plain python. I also used numpy.

4. **Architecture Design:** The heart of our neural network is its architecture. This encompasses the design of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers. These layers work collaboratively to learn and predict the numbers within the input images.

### Training the Model

5. **Backpropagation:** A fundamental concept in training neural networks is backpropagation. This iterative process fine-tunes the network's internal parameters, such as weights and biases, to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.

6. **Training Process:** The actual training phase involves feeding the neural network with images from the training dataset. After each pass, the model's performance is assessed, enabling us to gauge its accuracy. This process is repeated until the model achieves satisfactory levels of accuracy and can confidently classify handwritten numbers.


## Usage

Our trained model can be used to classify new images of handwritten digits by providing these images as input to the model. Additionally, you have the flexibility to integrate this model into your own applications for digit recognition, simplifying tasks that involve recognizing and categorizing numbers.
